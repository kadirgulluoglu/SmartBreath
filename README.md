# SmartBreath
## My first project with flutter. This project is supported by TUBITAK.

## Recv data from esp32 using flutter blue and marking data from google maps
### The aim of the project, which is designed to prevent respiratory system disorders;</br>Sending data such as temperature, humidity etc. to mobile application via ESP32. If these data are high values, warn the user via notification. By marking risky areas on Google Maps, allowing users to see whether their destination is risky or not.
